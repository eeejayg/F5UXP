Route Domains never overlap in their IP space, therefore it is impossible to have a 
VIP 1.2.3.4 on both RouteDomain0 and RouteDomain1.  Therefore it is not necessary to specify the 
route domain in the resource URL to a VIP.  However, it is convenient for us to know the 
RouteDomain of a VIP so we can display it in the heirarchical tree view.

There are Protocol settings that would cause the Ports list to be meaningless.  Therefore, when
certain Protocol settings are chosen, the Ports list must be set to blank.  There is probably
the need to save the last Ports list setting however, because if a user switches the Protocol back
to a meaningful setting, we might want to restore the ports list.

In a Rule:
  if status=scheduled, schedule=someScheduleName
  if schedule=someScheduleName, status=scheduled
  if schedule=blank, status=enabled
Do we need to toggle status back to the last stored value?  Hope not.
