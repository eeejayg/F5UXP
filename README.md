F5UXP
=====
This is a client project for F5 Networks and is an early version of their front-end for their firewall product.  You can download the project and run it by simply opening index.html in a browser.  Of the many interesting features of this project: (1) complex "spreadsheet-in-a-spreadsheet" functionality; (2) server agnostic front-end code; (3) a very pleasing (and difficult to implement) jQuery control for presentation of the data.
